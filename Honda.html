    <P class="text-honda">
        Soichiro's original idea was to manufacture bicycles with motors. After the war, Soichiro bought some bicycles and engines that the army auctioned at affordable prices. With these materials and a great imagination, Honda began working in its Hamamatsu workshop.
    <br>
        The first engine used in bicycles was too heavy and the firm quickly broke. However, Honda did not give up and manufactured a lighter, faster and quieter engine that immediately succeeded. Soichiro Honda managed to adapt the engines to bicycles with good results and in 1946 he manufactured his first motorcycle the Honda S. Somewhat later, he made his own 50cc two-stroke engine known as the A-Type.

    <h2 class="populari">The most popular motorcycle of Honda is the CBR model</h2>
    <p class="populari-text">
        The CBR is a series of motorcycles from the Japanese manufacturer Honda. Originally with four-cylinder in-line engines in various displacements, at the beginning of the XXI century single-cylinder engines of low displacement were incorporated, and new two-cylinder engines in line since 2012.

        The Honda CBR1000RR is the superbike of the Japanese brand that receives much of the technology used in MotoGP. A second version with ABS braking (338,000.00 MXN) is marketed.
     </p>
<br>
     <p>
        The CBR1000RR inherits all the technology in terms of engine and part cycle of the special RC213V-S street and adds the aerodynamics used by the competition version to create a sports car of 1000 totally focused on its use on the circuit. Therefore, it does not take as a basis the previous version, not even the engine, which is newly created and has the same diameter and stroke measures as the RC213V racing car. 
     </p>
<br>
     <p>
        It is a compact engine equipped with low friction technology that offers more than remarkable performance. The exhaust is also new and has been developed jointly with Akrapovic and is made of titanium. Its power is 190 hp, which makes it one of the most powerful superbikes of the moment.

        <h3 class="technical-data">Technical data sheet</h3>
        <p class="text-technical">
            The CBR 900 of 25 years ago weighed 197 kilos and yielded 122 hp, scandalous figures for the time. Today we can talk about almost a kilo per horse, because the engine of the new Honda CBR 1000 RR offers 190 hp for 195 kilos. The secret of the effectiveness of a sports car lies, basically, in getting a compact and light set with a powerful engine, and it is precisely what Honda has wanted to apply in its latest model.
